# Disease Prediction using Classification Models

This repository contains various machine learning models to predict different diseases using classification algorithms. The models included are:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for predicting Alzheimer's disease
- **Decision Tree Classifier** for predicting breast cancer
- **Random Forest Classifier** for predicting heart disease

## Project Structure

- `alzheimers_pred_SVM.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for Alzheimer's disease prediction using SVM.
- `breastcancer-pred_DTC.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for breast cancer prediction using Decision Tree.
- `heartdisease-pred_RFC.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for heart disease prediction using Random Forest.
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used for training and testing the models.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

## Usage
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/JonathanPollyn/Disease-Prediction-using-Classification.git
- cd Disease-Prediction-using-Classification

## Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

## Open the desired notebook and run the cells to see the results

- Models
Alzheimer's Disease Prediction
- The SVM model is used to predict Alzheimer's disease based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset containing patient information and their diagnosis.

## Breast Cancer Prediction
- The Decision Tree Classifier is used to predict breast cancer. The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Heart Disease Prediction
- The Random Forest Classifier is used to predict heart disease. The model is trained on the Heart Disease dataset.
